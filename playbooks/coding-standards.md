# Coding Standards

- Use project-appropriate formatter/linter (Black/Ruff, Prettier/ESLint, gofmt).
- Add tests with any non-trivial change; keep diffs small and reviewable.
- Conventional Commits preferred (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:).
- No secrets in git; use env or EOS CONFIGURATION/AUTH.
- Update playbooks or project README when behavior changes.
