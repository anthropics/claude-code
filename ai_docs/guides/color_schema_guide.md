# Color Schema System of the Claude Neural Framework

This guide explains how to use and customize the color schema system of the Claude Neural Framework to ensure a consistent user interface for all generated content.

## Overview

The color schema system allows you to establish a consistent color scheme for all components of the Claude Neural Framework. This includes:

- UI components such as dashboards, forms, and visualizations
- Content generated by Claude and other agents
- Reports and documentation
- Prompt outputs and code examples

The system is fully customizable and is automatically applied to all newly generated content.

## Interactive Setup

The easiest method to configure your color schema is the interactive setup assistant:

```bash
node scripts/setup/setup_user_colorschema.js
```

Alternatively, you can use the SAAR script:

```bash
./saar.sh colors
```

The assistant guides you through the following steps:

1. **Choose Base Theme**: Select a predefined theme as a starting point (Light, Dark, Blue, Green, Purple)
2. **Customize Colors**: Adjust primary colors, status colors, and background colors
3. **Preview**: See a preview of your customized color schema
4. **Save and Apply**: Save the color schema and apply it to existing UI components

## Available Themes

The framework provides the following predefined themes:

- **Light**: Light theme with blue accents
- **Dark**: Dark theme with purple accents
- **Blue**: Blue theme with light blue accents
- **Green**: Green theme with light green accents
- **Purple**: Purple theme with pink accents

## Manual Configuration

You can also configure the color schema manually:

```bash
# Set specific theme
node core/mcp/color_schema_manager.js --template=dark

# Apply color schema to existing UI components
node core/mcp/color_schema_manager.js --template=light --apply=true

# Export color schema as CSS
node core/mcp/color_schema_manager.js --non-interactive --format=css
```

## Integration with `.about` Profile

Your color schema is automatically integrated with your `.about` profile and stored in the `~/.claude/` directory. This allows Claude and other agents to consider your color schema when generating content.

Example of an `.about` profile with color schema:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user-12345",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "goals": ["Develop AI applications"],
  "companies": ["Sample Company Inc."],
  "preferences": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "lang": "en",
    "colorScheme": {
      "primary": "#bb86fc",
      "secondary": "#03dac6",
      "accent": "#cf6679",
      "background": "#121212",
      "text": "#ffffff"
    }
  },
  "is_agent": true
}
```

## Programmatic Access to the Color Schema

You can access the color schema in your own scripts and applications:

```javascript
const colorSchemaManager = require('./core/mcp/color_schema_manager');

// Get current color schema
const schema = colorSchemaManager.getColorSchema();

// Export color schema as CSS
const css = colorSchemaManager.generateCSS(schema);

// Apply color schema
colorSchemaManager.applyColorSchema(schema);
```

## Customizing Claude Prompts with Color Schema

To ensure that Claude-generated content uses your color schema, include the color schema as part of the prompt:

```javascript
const schema = colorSchemaManager.getColorSchema();

const claudePrompt = `
<instructions>
You are generating UI components for the Claude Neural Framework.
ALWAYS use the following color schema:

- Primary: ${schema.colors.primary}
- Secondary: ${schema.colors.secondary}
- Accent: ${schema.colors.accent}
- Background: ${schema.colors.background}
- Text: ${schema.colors.text}

All generated CSS, HTML, and JavaScript content must use this color schema.
</instructions>

${userPrompt}
`;
```

## Integration with Agent-to-Agent Communication

The color schema is automatically integrated with the agent-to-agent (A2A) communication protocol. This allows agents like the Git agent to use the same color schema for their output:

```javascript
// Example of sending a color schema-aware message to the Git agent
const a2aManager = require('./core/mcp/a2a_manager');
const colorSchemaManager = require('./core/mcp/color_schema_manager');

const schema = colorSchemaManager.getColorSchema();

const message = {
  from: 'user-agent',
  to: 'git-agent',
  task: 'git-operation',
  params: {
    operation: 'status',
    color_schema: schema.colors
  },
  conversationId: 'session-123'
};

a2aManager.sendMessage(message);
```

## Technical Details

The color schema system is based on CSS variables and can be exported in various formats:

- **CSS**: For web components and dashboards
- **SCSS**: For SCSS/Sass-based projects
- **JavaScript**: For programmatic access

The CSS variables are designed to be compatible with common CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Material Design.

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Use the same color schema for all components and generated content
- **Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors
- **Theme-based**: Start with a predefined theme and then customize it, rather than starting from scratch
- **Documentation**: Document your color schema for other developers

## Troubleshooting

If issues with the color schema arise:

1. Check the file `~/.claude/user.colorschema.json`
2. Run the interactive setup assistant again
3. Verify that the CSS file `ui/dashboard/color-schema.css` was correctly generated
4. Ensure that your HTML files correctly include the CSS file

## Conclusion

The color schema system of the Claude Neural Framework offers a powerful and flexible way to ensure a consistent user interface for all generated content. Through integration with the `.about` profile and customization of Claude prompts, you can ensure that all components and generated content conform to your defined style.
