# Security Policy for Claude Neural Framework

This document outlines the security policy for the Claude Neural Framework. It defines the security principles, requirements, and processes that must be followed by all contributors and users of the framework.

## 1. Security Principles

The Claude Neural Framework follows these core security principles:

### 1.1 Security by Design

Security is an integral part of the design and development process, not an afterthought. Security considerations must be incorporated from the earliest stages of development.

### 1.2 Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security controls are implemented to protect against different types of threats. No single control is relied upon exclusively.

### 1.3 Principle of Least Privilege

Components, processes, and users are granted the minimum level of access and permissions necessary to perform their functions.

### 1.4 Security as a Shared Responsibility

Security is the responsibility of everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of the framework.

### 1.5 Secure by Default

Default configurations prioritize security over convenience. Secure options are enabled by default.

## 3. Security Process

### 3.1 Security Review Process

The security review process consists of these key steps:

1. **Automated Security Scanning:**
   - Run the security review tool to identify potential vulnerabilities
   - Address all critical and high severity issues
   - Document and track medium and low severity issues

2. **Manual Security Review:**
   - Review security checklist items
   - Examine access control implementations
   - Validate input validation and output encoding
   - Review encryption implementations
   - Check error handling and logging

3. **Security Documentation:**
   - Document security controls
   - Update security documentation with findings
   - Document remediation actions
   - Update risk register if needed

4. **Security Approval:**
   - Review security findings and remediations
   - Obtain approval from the security team
   - Document security exceptions with justifications
   - Ensure all critical and high issues are addressed

### 3.2 Vulnerability Management

The vulnerability management process includes:

1. **Identification:**
   - Regular scanning for vulnerabilities
   - Monitoring of security advisories
   - Bug bounty and responsible disclosure programs

2. **Assessment:**
   - Validation of reported vulnerabilities
   - Severity assessment using CVSS or similar methodology
   - Impact analysis for the framework

3. **Remediation:**
   - Development of fixes or mitigations
   - Testing of security patches
   - Deployment of security updates
   - Communication with affected users

4. **Verification:**
   - Validation that vulnerabilities are properly fixed
   - Regression testing to ensure fixes don't introduce new issues
   - Documentation of resolved vulnerabilities

### 3.3 Security Incident Response

In the event of a security incident:

1. **Identification and Reporting:**
   - Recognize potential security incidents
   - Report incidents to the security team immediately
   - Preserve evidence for investigation

2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Implement immediate mitigations
   - Prevent further damage

3. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze the incident
   - Determine the root cause
   - Assess the impact and damage

4. **Remediation:**
   - Implement permanent fixes
   - Remove any malicious code or unauthorized access
   - Restore systems to normal operation

5. **Communication:**
   - Notify affected users if required
   - Provide clear information about the incident
   - Share remediation steps and best practices

6. **Post-Incident Review:**
