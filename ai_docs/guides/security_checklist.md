## How to Use This Checklist

1. **Before starting development:**
   - Review the checklist to understand security requirements
   - Implement security by design principles
   - Consider security implications of architectural decisions

2. **During development:**
   - Regularly check code against relevant items
   - Include security considerations in code reviews
   - Run automated security checks as part of the development process

3. **Before deployment:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review using this checklist
   - Ensure all critical and high-risk items are addressed
   - Document any accepted risks for later reassessment

4. **After deployment:**
   - Continue monitoring for security issues
   - Update the checklist as new security concerns emerge
   - Conduct periodic security reviews

## Running the Security Review Tool

The Claude Neural Framework includes a security review tool that automates many of these checks. Run it using:

```bash
# Basic security check
node core/security/security_check.js

# Detailed check with report
node core/security/security_check.js --verbose --output security-report.json

# Check specific directories or files
node core/security/security_check.js --dir ./core --files file1.js,file2.js
```

The security review tool generates a report with:
- Security score
- Identified vulnerabilities
- Findings that require attention
- Recommendations for remediation

## Security Review Process

Follow this process for conducting security reviews:

1. **Automated Checks:**
   - Run the security review tool
   - Address all critical and high severity issues
   - Document accepted risks for medium and low issues

2. **Manual Review:**
   - Review the checklist items that require manual inspection
   - Check for logic flaws not detectable by automated tools
   - Verify that security controls are properly implemented

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update security documentation with findings
   - Document remediation actions
   - Update risk register if needed

4. **Follow-up:**
   - Address findings according to severity and priority
   - Verify fixes with additional testing
   - Conduct regular reassessments
