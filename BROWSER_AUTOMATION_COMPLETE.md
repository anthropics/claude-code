# 🌐 Browser Automation Integration Complete

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

**✅ SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Claude Code now has native web browser interaction capabilities with visual feedback and step-by-step workflows!

### 🚀 Problem Solved
> **User Request**: "I want to add native web browser based interaction capabilities with Claude Code in which currently the problem is that the claude-code can easily run and see inside a terminal what is the output of what command or anything but in the terminal only. But when it comes to the things out of the terminal it has no capabilities. That I want to add."

**✅ SOLUTION DELIVERED**: Claude Code can now autonomously interact with websites, take screenshots, and execute complex browser workflows using natural language commands.
