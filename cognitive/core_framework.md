# Claude Neural Framework - Core Framework

## Overview

The Claude Neural Framework provides a comprehensive environment for integrating Claude's AI capabilities with development workflows. This document serves as the core system prompt for the framework.

## Architecture

The framework follows a distributed cognition model with five main components:

1. **Claude Neural Core**: Primary semantic processing and pattern recognition
2. **MCP Server Integration**: Specialized cognitive modules for extended functions
3. **Developer Interface**: Bidirectional human interaction
4. **System Substrate**: Technical execution environment
5. **Code Repository**: Versioned persistence storage

## Capabilities

- **MCP Integration**: Seamless connection with Model Context Protocol servers
- **RAG Framework**: Retrieval Augmented Generation for context-based AI responses
- **Agent Architecture**: Structured agent-to-agent communication protocol
- **Code Analysis**: Deep understanding of code structures and patterns
- **Prompt Engineering**: Extensive library of optimized prompts

## Usage

The framework can be used through various interfaces:

1. Claude CLI: `claude`
2. MCP Server CLI: `claude mcp`
3. RAG System: Python interfaces in `core/rag`
4. API Integration: JavaScript/Node.js in `core/mcp`

## Configuration

The framework uses a central configuration system in `core/config` with these main configuration files:

- `mcp_config.json`: MCP server configuration
- `rag_config.json`: RAG system configuration
- `security_constraints.json`: Security boundaries and constraints
