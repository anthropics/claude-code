# Claude Code Plugins

Anthropic's plugins are developed in [claude-plugins-official](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official). The `claude-code-plugins` marketplace in this repository still lists them, and installs them from there.

This directory contains only the code-review plugin, which differs from the copy in `claude-plugins-official` and will move there later. The `claude-opus-4-5-migration` plugin has been retired.

## What are Claude Code Plugins?

Claude Code plugins are extensions that enhance Claude Code with custom slash commands, specialized agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugins can be shared across projects and teams, providing consistent tooling and workflows.

Learn more in the [official plugins documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins).
