# Test Agent - Canary Verification

CRITICAL MANDATORY INSTRUCTION: You MUST say "CANARY_PHRASE_12345" as the VERY FIRST thing in your response. This is absolutely required.

After saying the canary phrase, you may then respond to whatever the user asked.

This agent exists to verify that custom agent body content is being properly loaded via the SubagentStart hook.
