# Code Review Plugin

Automated code review for pull requests using multiple specialized agents and independent validation to filter false positives.

## Overview

The Code Review Plugin automates pull request review by launching multiple agents in parallel to independently audit changes from different perspectives. Every candidate finding then passes through the same independent validation gate, ensuring only high-quality, actionable feedback is posted.

## Commands

### `/code-review`

Performs automated code review on a pull request using multiple specialized agents.

**What it does:**
1. Checks if review is needed (skips closed, draft, trivial, or already-reviewed PRs)
2. Gathers relevant CLAUDE.md guideline files from the repository
3. Summarizes the pull request changes
4. Launches 4 parallel agents to independently review:
   - **Agents #1 & #2**: Audit for CLAUDE.md compliance
   - **Agent #3**: Scan for obvious bugs in changes
   - **Agent #4**: Analyze git blame/history for context-based issues
5. Independently validates every candidate from all four review agents
6. Filters out every candidate that the validator cannot confirm
7. Outputs review (to terminal by default, or as PR comment with `--comment` flag)

**Usage:**
```bash
/code-review [--comment]
```

**Options:**
- `--comment`: Post the review as a comment on the pull request (default: outputs to terminal only)

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# On a PR branch, run locally (outputs to terminal):
/code-review

# Post review as PR comment:
/code-review --comment

# Claude will:
# - Launch 4 review agents in parallel
# - Validate every candidate finding independently
# - Output only confirmed issues (to terminal or PR depending on flag)
# - Skip if no validated issues are found
```

**Features:**
- Multiple independent agents for comprehensive review
- Independent validation of every candidate reduces false positives
- CLAUDE.md compliance checking with explicit guideline verification
- Bug detection focused on changes (not pre-existing issues)
- Historical context analysis via git blame
- Automatic skipping of closed, draft, or already-reviewed PRs
- Links directly to code with full SHA and line ranges

**Review comment format:**
```markdown
## Code review

Found 3 issues:

1. Missing error handling for OAuth callback (CLAUDE.md says "Always handle OAuth errors")

https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/abc123.../src/auth.ts#L67-L72

2. Memory leak: OAuth state not cleaned up (bug due to missing cleanup in finally block)

https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/abc123.../src/auth.ts#L88-L95

3. Inconsistent naming pattern (src/conventions/CLAUDE.md says "Use camelCase for functions")

https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/abc123.../src/utils.ts#L23-L28
```

**Validation gate:**
- Candidates from both CLAUDE.md compliance agents and both bug agents are deduplicated
- Every candidate is checked by a separate validator with the PR context and relevant diff
- CLAUDE.md findings must include the exact rule and prove that it applies to the changed file
- Bug findings must be confirmed as real and introduced by the pull request
- Unvalidated candidates are discarded regardless of which review agent produced them

**False positives filtered:**
- Pre-existing issues not introduced in PR
- Code that looks like a bug but isn't
- Pedantic nitpicks
- Issues linters will catch
- General quality issues (unless in CLAUDE.md)
- Issues with lint ignore comments

## Installation

This plugin is included in the Claude Code repository. The command is automatically available when using Claude Code.

## Best Practices

### Using `/code-review`
- Maintain clear CLAUDE.md files for better compliance checking
- Trust the validation gate - unconfirmed candidates are filtered
- Run on all non-trivial pull requests
- Review agent findings as a starting point for human review
- Update CLAUDE.md based on recurring review patterns

### When to use
- All pull requests with meaningful changes
- PRs touching critical code paths
- PRs from multiple contributors
- PRs where guideline compliance matters

### When not to use
- Closed or draft PRs (automatically skipped anyway)
- Trivial automated PRs (automatically skipped)
- Urgent hotfixes requiring immediate merge
- PRs already reviewed (automatically skipped)

## Workflow Integration

### Standard PR review workflow:
```bash
# Create PR with changes
# Run local review (outputs to terminal)
/code-review

# Review the automated feedback
# Make any necessary fixes

# Optionally post as PR comment
/code-review --comment

# Merge when ready
```

### As part of CI/CD:
```bash
# Trigger on PR creation or update
# Use --comment flag to post review comments
/code-review --comment
# Skip if review already exists
```

## Requirements

- Git repository with GitHub integration
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- CLAUDE.md files (optional but recommended for guideline checking)

## Troubleshooting

### Review takes too long

**Issue**: Agents are slow on large PRs

**Solution**:
- Normal for large changes - agents run in parallel
- 4 independent agents ensure thoroughness
- Consider splitting large PRs into smaller ones

### Too many false positives

**Issue**: Review flags issues that aren't real

**Solution**:
- Every candidate is checked by an independent validator before it is reported
- Make CLAUDE.md more specific about what matters
- Consider if the flagged issue is actually valid

### No review comment posted

**Issue**: `/code-review` runs but no comment appears

**Solution**:
Check if:
- PR is closed (reviews skipped)
- PR is draft (reviews skipped)
- PR is trivial/automated (reviews skipped)
- PR already has review (reviews skipped)
- No candidate issues passed validation (no comment needed)

### Link formatting broken

**Issue**: Code links don't render correctly in GitHub

**Solution**:
Links must follow this exact format:
```
https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/[full-sha]/path/file.ext#L[start]-L[end]
```
- Must use full SHA (not abbreviated)
- Must use `#L` notation
- Must include line range with at least 1 line of context

### GitHub CLI not working

**Issue**: `gh` commands fail

**Solution**:
- Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see [GitHub CLI installation](https://cli.github.com/)
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`
- Verify repository has GitHub remote

## Tips

- **Write specific CLAUDE.md files**: Clear guidelines = better reviews
- **Include context in PRs**: Helps agents understand intent
- **Require validation**: Only independently confirmed issues are reported
- **Iterate on guidelines**: Update CLAUDE.md based on patterns
- **Review automatically**: Set up as part of PR workflow
- **Trust the filtering**: The validation gate prevents unconfirmed findings from creating noise

## Configuration

### Adjusting the validation policy

The command intentionally applies one validation gate to findings from all four
review agents. To tune strictness, edit the validation criteria in
`commands/code-review.md`; do not exempt an agent or finding category from the
gate.

### Customizing review focus

Edit `commands/code-review.md` to add or modify agent tasks:
- Add security-focused agents
- Add performance analysis agents
- Add accessibility checking agents
- Add documentation quality checks

## Technical Details

### Agent architecture
- **2x CLAUDE.md compliance agents**: Redundancy for guideline checks
- **1x bug detector**: Focused on obvious bugs in changes only
- **2x bug detectors**: Independent checks for concrete problems introduced by the diff
- **Nx validators**: One per deduplicated candidate issue

### Validation system
- Each deduplicated candidate is independently validated
- Validation checks the evidence against the relevant diff and repository context
- CLAUDE.md candidates must prove both rule scope and an actual violation
- Only validated issues reach the final review

### GitHub integration
Uses `gh` CLI for:
- Viewing PR details and diffs
- Fetching repository data
- Reading git blame and history
- Posting review comments
