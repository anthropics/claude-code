# Commit Commands Plugin

Streamline your git workflow with simple commands for committing, pushing, and creating pull requests.

## Overview

The Commit Commands Plugin automates common git operations, reducing context switching and manual command execution. Instead of running multiple git commands, use a single slash command to handle your entire workflow.

## Commands

### `/commit`

Creates a git commit with an automatically generated commit message based on staged and unstaged changes.

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes current git status
2. Reviews both staged and unstaged changes
3. Examines recent commit messages to match your repository's style
4. Drafts an appropriate commit message
5. Stages relevant files
6. Creates the commit

**Usage:**
```bash
/commit
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Make some changes to your code
# Then simply run:
/commit

# Claude will:
# - Review your changes
# - Stage the files
# - Create a commit with an appropriate message
# - Show you the commit status
```

**Features:**
- Automatically drafts commit messages that match your repo's style
- Follows conventional commit practices
- Avoids committing files with secrets (.env, credentials.json)
- Includes Claude Code attribution in commit message

### `/commit-review`

Creates a git commit with interactive message review, allowing you to edit the commit message before finalizing.

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes staged changes
2. Generates or uses provided commit message
3. Shows a summary of changes to be committed
4. Lets you review, edit, or cancel the commit
5. Creates the commit only after approval

**Usage:**
```bash
# With auto-generated message:
/commit-review

# With custom message:
/commit-review "feat: add user authentication"
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Make and stage your changes
git add .

# Run the interactive commit:
/commit-review

# Claude will:
# - Show what will be committed
# - Present a draft commit message
# - Ask for confirmation with options to:
#   - Use the draft message
#   - Edit the message
#   - Cancel the commit
```

**Features:**
- Interactive commit message review
- Option to provide custom message upfront
- Shows change summary before committing
- Ability to edit generated messages
- Safe cancellation option

### `/commit-interactive`

Advanced interactive commit workflow with full control over message editing and file staging.

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes all changes (staged and unstaged)
2. Generates a draft commit message
3. Allows interactive message editing
4. Lets you select which files to include
5. Creates commit based on your selections

**Usage:**
```bash
/commit-interactive
```

**Features:**
- Full interactive control
- Multi-select file staging
- Custom message editing
- Preview before commit
- Granular file selection

### `/commit-push-pr`

Complete workflow command that commits, pushes, and creates a pull request in one step.

**What it does:**
1. Creates a new branch (if currently on main)
2. Stages and commits changes with an appropriate message
3. Pushes the branch to origin
4. Creates a pull request using `gh pr create`
5. Provides the PR URL

**Usage:**
```bash
/commit-push-pr
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Make your changes
# Then run:
/commit-push-pr

# Claude will:
# - Create a feature branch (if needed)
# - Commit your changes
# - Push to remote
# - Open a PR with summary and test plan
# - Give you the PR URL to review
```

**Features:**
- Analyzes all commits in the branch (not just the latest)
- Creates comprehensive PR descriptions with:
  - Summary of changes (1-3 bullet points)
  - Test plan checklist
  - Claude Code attribution
- Handles branch creation automatically
- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR creation

**Requirements:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Repository must have a remote named `origin`

### `/clean_gone`

Cleans up local branches that have been deleted from the remote repository.

**What it does:**
1. Lists all local branches to identify [gone] status
2. Identifies and removes worktrees associated with [gone] branches
3. Deletes all branches marked as [gone]
4. Provides feedback on removed branches

**Usage:**
```bash
/clean_gone
```

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# After PRs are merged and remote branches are deleted
/clean_gone

# Claude will:
# - Find all branches marked as [gone]
# - Remove any associated worktrees
# - Delete the stale local branches
# - Report what was cleaned up
```

**Features:**
- Handles both regular branches and worktree branches
- Safely removes worktrees before deleting branches
- Shows clear feedback about what was removed
- Reports if no cleanup was needed

**When to use:**
- After merging and deleting remote branches
- When your local branch list is cluttered with stale branches
- During regular repository maintenance

## Installation

This plugin is included in the Claude Code repository. The commands are automatically available when using Claude Code.

## Best Practices

### Using `/commit`
- Review the staged changes before committing
- Let Claude analyze your changes and match your repo's commit style
- Trust the automated message, but verify it's accurate
- Use for routine commits during development

### Using `/commit-review`
- Best for when you want to review the message before committing
- Provide a custom message if you have specific wording in mind
- Use when commit message accuracy is critical
- Ideal for commits that will be part of public history

### Using `/commit-interactive`
- Use when you need full control over the commit
- Ideal for complex changes with mixed staged/unstaged files
- Best when you want to carefully curate what gets committed
- Perfect for partial commits of work in progress

### Using `/commit-push-pr`
- Use when you're ready to create a PR
- Ensure all your changes are complete and tested
- Claude will analyze the full branch history for the PR description
- Review the PR description and edit if needed
- Use when you want to minimize context switching

### Using `/clean_gone`
- Run periodically to keep your branch list clean
- Especially useful after merging multiple PRs
- Safe to run - only removes branches already deleted remotely
- Helps maintain a tidy local repository

## Workflow Integration

### Quick commit workflow:
```bash
# Write code
/commit
# Continue development
```

### Feature branch workflow:
```bash
# Develop feature across multiple commits
/commit  # First commit
# More changes
/commit  # Second commit
# Ready to create PR
/commit-push-pr
```

### Maintenance workflow:
```bash
# After several PRs are merged
/clean_gone
# Clean workspace ready for next feature
```

## Requirements

- Git must be installed and configured
- For `/commit-push-pr`: GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Repository must be a git repository with a remote

## Troubleshooting

### `/commit` creates empty commit

**Issue**: No changes to commit

**Solution**:
- Ensure you have unstaged or staged changes
- Run `git status` to verify changes exist

### `/commit-push-pr` fails to create PR

**Issue**: `gh pr create` command fails

**Solution**:
- Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see [GitHub CLI installation](https://cli.github.com/)
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`
- Ensure repository has a GitHub remote

### `/clean_gone` doesn't find branches

**Issue**: No branches marked as [gone]

**Solution**:
- Run `git fetch --prune` to update remote tracking
- Branches must be deleted from the remote to show as [gone]

## Tips

- **Combine with other tools**: Use `/commit` during development, then `/commit-push-pr` when ready
- **Let Claude draft messages**: The commit message analysis learns from your repo's style
- **Regular cleanup**: Run `/clean_gone` weekly to maintain a clean branch list
- **Review before pushing**: Always review the commit message and changes before pushing
