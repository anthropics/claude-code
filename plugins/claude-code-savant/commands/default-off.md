Savant Default Mode has been **disabled**.

## What This Means

- Questions will no longer be automatically routed to Savant personas
- Normal Claude behavior is restored
- You can still use Savant manually with specific commands

## Manual Commands Still Available

| Command | Persona | Use For |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/savant` | Smart Router | Auto-detect best persona |
| `/savant-question` | Einstein | Deep explanations |
| `/savant-code` | Shakespeare | Code analysis |
| `/savant-new` | Steve Jobs | Project direction |

## Re-enable Default Mode

To re-enable automatic routing, use: `/savant-default`
