# Neon Branch Cleanup
#
# Deletes the Neon database branch when a pull request is closed or merged.

# Neon project resources.
#
# Branch naming convention: preview/pr-{number} (matches preview-deploy.yml)
#
# Required secrets:
#   NEON_API_KEY          - Neon API key
#
# Required variables:
#   NEON_PROJECT_ID       - Neon project ID
