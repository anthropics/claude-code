Adds Calva REPL window config and .lsp/.clj-kondo cache files.

This change introduces a default Calva REPL output window configuration file and adds `.lsp` and `.clj-kondo` cache files, likely to improve the development environment. The REPL window config includes instructions and settings for Calva REPL usage.

### Changes
- Added a new file `.calva/output-window/output.calva-repl` which configures the Calva REPL output window, providing usage instructions and a link to documentation.  It also includes a note about a planned future path change for the REPL window file location.
- Added `.clj-kondo/.cache/v1/lock` and `.lsp/.cache/db.transit.json` files. These appear to be cache files for clj-kondo and the LSP server, respectively. `.lsp/.cache/db.transit.json` contains project-specific information like classpath, project hash, and analysis data.

### Impact
- The addition of the Calva REPL window configuration file provides a default REPL output destination, potentially improving the user experience when using Calva.
- The `.lsp` and `.clj-kondo` cache files may improve performance by caching analysis results.  These files should be excluded from version control.
