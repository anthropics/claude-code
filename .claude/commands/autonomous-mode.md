# Autonomous Claude Code Mode

Activate fully autonomous software development with intelligent decision making, market awareness, and continuous evolution.

## Command
`/autonomous <user_request> [--mode <conservative|balanced|aggressive>] [--approval <auto|manual>]`

## Description

This command transforms Claude Code into a fully autonomous software development platform that:

- **🧠 Makes Intelligent Decisions**: Automatically determines which commands to run based on context
- **📊 Monitors Market Trends**: Incorporates real-time market intelligence into development decisions
- **🔄 Continuously Evolves**: Self-improving system that learns from feedback and outcomes
- **🎯 Goal-Oriented**: Focuses on user satisfaction, performance, and market competitiveness
- **⚡ Proactive Actions**: Takes initiative without waiting for explicit commands

## How It Works

### 1. Contextual Analysis
- Analyzes your request and current project state
- Gathers market intelligence and technology trends
- Identifies user demands and competitive landscape
- Assesses code quality and performance metrics

### 2. Autonomous Planning
- Automatically selects optimal sequence of commands
- Considers dependencies and execution order
- Incorporates market feedback and trend data
- Plans for continuous improvement cycles

### 3. Intelligent Execution
- Executes `/constitution`, `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement` as needed
- Triggers `/evolve` for performance optimization
- Monitors real-time feedback and adjusts approach
- Learns from outcomes to improve future decisions

### 4. Continuous Evolution
- Monitors user feedback and bug reports
- Tracks performance metrics and market changes
- Automatically triggers optimization cycles
- Adapts strategy based on success patterns

## Usage Examples

### Basic Autonomous Mode
```
/autonomous Build a photo management app with AI tagging capabilities
```
*→ Automatically runs constitution, specification, planning, tasks, implementation, and evolution*

### Conservative Mode (Manual Approval)
```
/autonomous Create a real-time chat application --mode conservative --approval manual
```
*→ Plans all actions but waits for your approval before execution*

### Aggressive Mode (Full Automation)
```
/autonomous Optimize my existing codebase for performance --mode aggressive --approval auto
```
*→ Immediately begins autonomous optimization with continuous evolution cycles*

### Market-Driven Development
```
/autonomous Build a developer tool that addresses current market gaps
```
*→ Researches market trends, identifies opportunities, and builds competitively*

## Mode Options

### Conservative Mode
- Requires manual approval for each major action
- Focuses on stability and proven approaches
- 3 evolution generations per cycle
- Lower risk, more predictable outcomes

### Balanced Mode (Default)
- Balances automation with safety
- Some actions auto-executed, major changes need approval
- 5 evolution generations per cycle
- Good balance of innovation and stability

### Aggressive Mode
- Full automation with minimal human intervention
- Continuously monitors and improves
- 10 evolution generations per cycle
- Maximum innovation, higher risk tolerance

## What Gets Automated
