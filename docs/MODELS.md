# üéØ Claude Model Selection Guide

***Choose the right Claude model for your task complexity and requirements***
***The right tool for  the  right job!***

This guide helps you pick the right Claude model for a task based on complexity, latency, cost, and context size. Use it to balance capability and budget across development, debugging, and automation workflows.

Key points:

- Consider complexity (simple ‚Üí Haiku 3.5, standard dev ‚Üí Sonnet 4, deep reasoning ‚Üí Opus 4.1).
- Prioritize latency and cost for quick iteractions; prioritize capability for architecture, audits, and complex debugging.
- Default recommendation: Sonnet 4 for daily development; escalate to Opus 4.1 for multi-step planning or heavy analysis; use Haiku 3.5 for fast, low-cost jobs.
- Configure via environment variables (CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL, CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_TOKENS) and switch models per workflow needs ‚Äî examples and tradeoffs follow.
- Refer to the sections below for model specs, example prompts, configuration snippets, and switching strategy.

## ‚ö° Claude Haiku 3.5 (`claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`)

### **When to Use**

- **Quick Fixes**: Simple bugs, typos, formatting
- **Atomic Tasks**: Single-purpose functions, utilities
- **Fast Responses**: Immediate answers, quick clarifications
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple small, similar tasks
- **Code Snippets**: Short examples, templates

### **Perfect For:**

```bash
# Examples of Haiku-worthy tasks:
- "Fix this typo in the variable name"
- "Add error handling to this HTTP request"
- "Generate a utility function to format dates"
- "Create a simple validation function"
- "Write a quick bash script to clean temp files"
```

### **Configuration:**

```env
CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL=claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_TOKENS=50000   # Optimized for shorter contexts
```

## üéõÔ∏è Model Switching Strategy

### **Development Workflow:**

1. **Start with Sonnet 4** (daily default)
2. **Escalate to Opus 4.1** when:
   - Task takes multiple attempts
   - Need deep analysis or planning
   - Working with complex/legacy code
   - Architecture decisions required

3. **Use Haiku 3.5** when:
   - Quick, obvious fixes needed
   - Batch processing simple tasks
   - Fast turnaround required
   - Cost optimization important

### **Dynamic Switching:**

```bash
# In your .env.local, comment/uncomment as needed:

# For complex planning session:
CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL=claude-opus-4-1-20250805

# For daily development:
# CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# For quick fixes:
# CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL=claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
```

2. If unsatisfied, retry with Opus 4.1
3. Compare results and note patterns
4. Build team knowledge of when to escalate

### **Team Learning:**

- Track which tasks need escalation to Opus
- Document model choice reasoning
- Share successful model selection patterns

- Update `.env.example` and documentation when new versions release
- Test new models with existing workflows
- Gradual migration strategy recommended
