## Backup Strategy

The Claude Neural Framework implements a comprehensive 3-2-1 backup strategy:

- **3** copies of data (primary + 2 backups)
- **2** different storage media types
- **1** off-site backup

This ensures redundancy, resilience against different types of failures, and protection against site-specific disasters.

## Data Categories

The framework's data is categorized by criticality and backup frequency requirements:

| Category | Description | Examples | Recovery Point Objective (RPO) |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------------------------------|
| Critical | Essential for core operation | Configuration, API keys, Vector DB | 1 hour |
| Important | Necessary for full functionality | Logs, Usage metrics | 1 day |
| Historical | Valuable for analysis | Historical logs, Performance metrics | 1 week |
| Disposable | Temporary files that can be regenerated | Cache files, Temporary downloads | No backup |

## Backup Frequency

Backup schedules are determined by data category:

| Category | Full Backup | Incremental Backup |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Critical | Daily | Hourly |
| Important | Weekly | Daily |
| Historical | Monthly | Weekly |

## Storage Strategy

The framework uses a multi-tiered storage approach:

1. **Primary Storage (Hot)**
   - Production databases and file systems
   - Optimized for performance and availability

2. **Secondary Storage (Warm)**
   - Local backup server or backup service
   - Fast restore capability
   - Daily synchronization

3. **Tertiary Storage (Cold)**
   - Off-site or cloud storage
   - Weekly synchronization
   - Encrypted and compressed

## Retention Policy

| Category | Local Retention | Off-site Retention |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Critical | 30 days | 1 year |
| Important | 90 days | 1 year |
| Historical | 180 days | 3 years |

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Configuration Recovery

```bash
# Restore configuration from backup
node scripts/backup/restore.js --target=configuration --date=YYYY-MM-DD

# Verify configuration integrity
node scripts/backup/verify.js --target=configuration
```

### 2. Database Recovery

```bash
# Restore RAG vector database
node scripts/backup/restore.js --target=vector-db --date=YYYY-MM-DD

# Verify database integrity
python core/rag/validate_db.py
```

### 3. Complete System Recovery

```bash
# Restore entire system
node scripts/backup/restore.js --full --date=YYYY-MM-DD

# Run system validation
node scripts/backup/system_verification.js
```

### 4. Point-in-Time Recovery

```bash
# Restore to a specific point in time (requires incremental backups)
node scripts/backup/restore.js --timestamp="YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
```

## Testing and Validation

The backup and recovery system should be tested regularly:

- **Monthly**: Restore a non-critical component
- **Quarterly**: Full restore test in staging environment
- **Bi-annually**: Full disaster recovery simulation

All tests should be documented with results and lessons learned.

## Automation

The framework includes automated scripts for:

1. **Scheduled Backups**
   - Managed through cron jobs or system scheduler
   - Configurable through `/core/config/backup_config.json`

2. **Monitoring**
   - Alerts for backup failures
   - Storage capacity monitoring
   - Backup integrity verification

3. **Simplified Recovery**
   - One-command restore for different scenarios
   - Guided recovery procedures

## Security Considerations

1. **Encryption**
   - All backups are encrypted at rest and in transit
   - Use AES-256 encryption for backup files
   - Key management procedures are documented in the security guide

2. **Access Control**
   - Backup access requires separate authentication
   - Multi-factor authentication for critical recovery operations
   - Role-based access for backup management

3. **Integrity Verification**
   - Checksums for all backup files
   - Automated integrity testing after backup completion
   - Signed backup manifests

## Disaster Recovery

For complete disaster recovery scenarios:

1. **Infrastructure Recovery**
   - Setup new environment following `/docs/guides/infrastructure_setup.md`
   - Configure networking and security

2. **Application Recovery**
   - Deploy application code from version control
   - Restore configuration and secrets
   - Restore databases and file storage

3. **Validation**
   - Run system health checks
   - Verify data integrity
   - Perform functionality tests

## Documentation and Training

1. **Recovery Runbooks**
   - Step-by-step procedures for common recovery scenarios
   - Decision trees for incident response
   - Contact information for support

2. **Training**
   - All operators should be trained on recovery procedures
   - Regular drills for critical recovery scenarios
   - Cross-training to avoid single points of failure

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Document lessons learned from recovery operations
   - Regular review and updates to recovery procedures
   - Incorporation of new best practices
