# Sequential Execution Manager Integration Guide

## Integration Summary

### Overview
This guide outlines the strategy for migrating the Sequential Execution Manager and related components from the existing architecture to the new claude-framework structure. The migration involves several interrelated components that must be carefully coordinated to maintain functionality throughout the transition.

### Key Components Identified
- Sequential Execution Manager core functionality
- Planners and Executors
- Integration with MCP services
- Documentation generation capabilities
- Frontend hooks and UI components
- Configuration systems
- Testing infrastructure

### Migration Approach
We will implement a gradual transition with compatibility layers to ensure that existing functionality remains available while new components are introduced. This phased approach will allow for thorough testing at each stage and minimize disruption to ongoing development.

- Utility functions for task management
- Helper libraries

### Scripts and Tools

- Testing tools
- Migration utilities

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Structure Migration
1. Set up the directory structure in the claude-framework for sequential components
2. Migrate core type definitions and interfaces
3. Implement basic Sequential Execution Manager functionality
4. Create compatibility layers to bridge old and new implementations

```typescript
// Example compatibility layer
import { SequentialExecutionManager as NewManager } from 'claude-framework/libs/workflows/src/sequential';

export class SequentialExecutionManager {
  private newManager: NewManager;
  
  constructor(config) {
    this.newManager = new NewManager(this.adaptConfig(config));
  }
  
  // Adapt old methods to new implementation
  async plan(task) {
    return this.newManager.plan(this.adaptTask(task));
  }
  
  // Helper methods to adapt between old and new formats
  private adaptConfig(oldConfig) {
    // Transform old config format to new format
  }
  
  private adaptTask(oldTask) {
    // Transform old task format to new format
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Component Migration
1. Migrate planner implementations
2. Migrate executor implementations
3. Migrate documentation generator
4. Implement MCP route handlers in the new structure

### Phase 3: Update References
1. Update imports and references in dependent code
2. Migrate frontend hooks to use new implementation
3. Update configuration files to support new structure
4. Update examples and tutorials

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Develop unit tests for migrated components
2. Implement integration tests to validate system behavior
3. Compare output between old and new implementations
4. Address any discrepancies or issues

### Phase 5: Cleanup
1. Deprecate old implementations
2. Remove compatibility layers
3. Update documentation to reflect only new implementation
4. Archive obsolete code

## Compatibility Strategy

### Backward Compatibility Approach

To maintain backward compatibility during the migration:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Implement adapters that translate between old and new interfaces.

```javascript
// Example adapter in src/tools/mcp/integration/sequential_execution_manager.js
const { SequentialExecutionManager: NewManager } = require('claude-framework/libs/workflows');

class LegacyAdapter {
  constructor() {
    this.newManager = new NewManager();
  }
  
  async execute(plan, options) {
    // Convert legacy format to new format
    const adaptedPlan = this.adaptPlan(plan);
    const adaptedOptions = this.adaptOptions(options);
    
    // Use new implementation
    const result = await this.newManager.execute(adaptedPlan, adaptedOptions);
    
    // Convert result back to legacy format
    return this.adaptResult(result);
  }
  
  // Helper methods
}

// Export legacy-compatible interface
module.exports = {
  createExecutionPlan: async (task) => {
    const adapter = new LegacyAdapter();
    return adapter.createPlan(task);
  },
  executeSequentialPlan: async (plan, options) => {
    const adapter = new LegacyAdapter();
    return adapter.execute(plan, options);
  }
};
```

2. **Feature Detection**: Allow systems to detect and use either implementation.

```javascript
// Example feature detection
function getSequentialExecutionManager() {
  try {
    // Try to use new implementation
    const { SequentialExecutionManager } = require('claude-framework/libs/workflows');
    return new SequentialExecutionManager();
  } catch (error) {
    // Fall back to old implementation
    const legacyManager = require('../tools/mcp/sequential_planner');
    return legacyManager;
  }
}
```

3. **Configuration Toggle**: Provide configuration options to explicitly choose implementation.

```javascript
// Example configuration-based selection
function initializeSequentialManager(config) {
  if (config.useNewImplementation) {
    const { SequentialExecutionManager } = require('claude-framework/libs/workflows');
    return new SequentialExecutionManager();
  } else {
    const legacyManager = require('../tools/mcp/sequential_planner');
    return legacyManager;
  }
}
```

### Deprecation Approach

The deprecation process will follow these steps:

1. **Phase 1 - Mark as Deprecated**:
   - Add deprecation notices in documentation
   - Add console warnings when using deprecated components
   - Provide migration guides for each component

2. **Phase 2 - Soft Deprecation**:
   - Continue to support but encourage migration
   - Add more detailed warnings with specific migration instructions
   - Begin to advertise end-of-support dates

3. **Phase 3 - Hard Deprecation**:
   - Make deprecated components emit errors (but still function)
   - Create automatic migration tools where possible
   - Provide extensive support for migration

4. **Phase 4 - Removal**:
   - Remove deprecated components from active codebase
   - Archive for historical reference if needed
   - Ensure all documentation points to new implementation

## Timeline and Milestones

| Phase | Estimated Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Core Structure Migration | 2 weeks | Basic Sequential Execution Manager in new structure |
| Component Migration | 3 weeks | All components migrated with tests |
| Update References | 2 weeks | All code references updated to new structure |
| Testing and Validation | 2 weeks | Full test coverage and validation |
| Cleanup | 1 week | Removal of deprecated code and compatibility layers |

## Conclusion

This migration will modernize the Sequential Execution Manager implementation while maintaining compatibility with existing systems. By following this phased approach, we can ensure a smooth transition to the new framework architecture without disrupting ongoing development efforts.

The end result will be a more maintainable, modular, and extensible Sequential Execution Manager that better integrates with the claude-framework architecture.
