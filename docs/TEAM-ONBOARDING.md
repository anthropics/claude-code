# üë• Team Onboarding Guide

*Get new team members productive with Claude Code & GitHub Copilot in 30 minutes*

## üéØ Welcome to AI-Assisted Development!

This repository uses cutting-edge AI tools to supercharge our development workflow:
- **GitHub Copilot**: Smart code completion with custom instructions
- **Claude Code Actions**: Automated PR reviews via `@claude` mentions
- **Model Selection**: Right AI tool for the right job

## ‚ö° Quick Start (30-Minute Setup)

### **Step 1: Prerequisites (5 minutes)**
- [ ] **GitHub Account**: Repository access to `nexcallai/code`
- [ ] **Anthropic Account**: Sign up at https://console.anthropic.com
- [ ] **Max Plan**: Upgrade for access to latest models
- [ ] **GitHub CLI**: Install from https://cli.github.com

### **Step 2: API Keys (5 minutes)**
1. **Get Your Claude API Key**:
   - Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
   - Click "Create API key" 
   - Name: "Personal Development - [Your Name]"
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

2. **Store Securely**:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env.local
   
   # Edit .env.local and add your key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-actual-key-here
   ```

### **Step 3: Local Setup (10 minutes)**
1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nexcallai/code.git
   cd code
   ```

2. **Configure Git**:
   ```bash
   git config user.name "Your Name"
   git config user.email "your.email@company.com"
   ```

3. **Authenticate GitHub CLI**:
   ```bash
   gh auth login --hostname github.com --web
   ```

### **Step 4: Test Setup (5 minutes)**
1. **Verify Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Should show your API key
   head -1 .env.local
   
   # Should show GitHub authentication
   gh auth status
   ```

2. **Test Claude Access**:
   ```bash
   # Test API connection
   curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/models \
        --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
        --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01"
   ```

### **Step 5: First AI Interaction (5 minutes)**
1. **Create Test Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-setup-$(date +%s)
   ```

2. **Test Copilot**: Start typing code - Copilot should follow our custom instructions
3. **Test Claude**: Create a PR and comment `@claude please review this setup`

## üõ†Ô∏è Daily Workflows

### **Morning Routine:**
1. **Pull Latest Changes**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Check Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Verify your setup is working
   echo $CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL  # Should show current model
   gh auth status           # Should show authenticated
   ```

### **Feature Development:**
1. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Choose Your AI Model** (see [MODELS.md](./MODELS.md)):
   - üéØ **Sonnet 4**: Default for daily development
   - üöÄ **Opus 4.1**: Complex features or architecture
   - ‚ö° **Haiku 3.5**: Quick fixes or utilities

3. **Code with AI Assistance**:
   - Let GitHub Copilot suggest code following our standards
   - Use Claude for complex problem-solving
   - Follow our TypeScript and security guidelines

4. **Create PR with AI Review**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Use the provided GitHub link to create PR
   # Add comment: "@claude please review this feature"
   ```

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### **AI Model Selection:**
```bash
# Daily development (80% of time)
CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Complex tasks (15% of time) 
CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL=claude-opus-4-1-20250805

# Quick fixes (5% of time)
CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL=claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
```

### **Effective AI Prompting:**

**Good Prompts:**
- "Implement user authentication with JWT, following our security guidelines"
- "Review this function for performance and suggest optimizations"
- "Create unit tests for this payment processing module"

**Avoid:**
- Vague requests: "make this better"
- Security-sensitive: Never share actual passwords/keys
- Overly broad: "rewrite this entire system"

### **Code Review with Claude:**

**Trigger Claude Reviews:**
```
@claude please review this PR for:
- Security best practices
- TypeScript compliance
- Test coverage
- Performance considerations
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### **Common Issues:**

**GitHub CLI Not Working:**
```bash
# Clear environment conflicts
unset GITHUB_TOKEN
gh auth login --web
```

**API Key Not Working:**
```bash
# Check your key format
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | head -c 10  # Should start with "sk-ant-"
```

**Copilot Not Following Instructions:**
- Check `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists and is committed
- May take 5-10 minutes after committing to take effect
- Try restarting VS Code/your editor

**For detailed troubleshooting**, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
