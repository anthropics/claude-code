- **🔄 Continuously Evolves**: Self-improving code optimization using evolutionary algorithms
- **⚡ Takes Proactive Action**: Anticipates needs without waiting for explicit commands
- **🌐 Has Global Awareness**: Integrates web search for market intelligence and competitive analysis

### ⚡ One Command, Infinite Possibilities

```bash
# Simply describe what you want to build
/autonomous "Create a developer tool that addresses current market gaps"

# Watch as it automatically:
# 1. 🔍 Researches market trends and competitors
# 2. 📋 Creates project constitution with market intelligence
# 3. 📝 Generates specifications with competitive analysis
# 4. 🔧 Plans implementation with trending technologies
# 5. ⚙️  Executes tasks with continuous monitoring
# 6. 🧬 Evolves code using multi-objective optimization
# 7. 🔄 Schedules future improvement cycles
```

## 🎯 Enhanced Development Workflows

### Structured Development (Spec-Kit Integration)
- `/constitution`: Create market-aware project principles
- `/specify`: Generate competitive specifications with user demand analysis
- `/plan`: Build implementation plans using trending technologies
- `/tasks`: Create prioritized task lists based on market data
- `/implement`: Execute development with continuous quality monitoring

### Evolutionary Optimization (ShinkaEvolve Integration)
- `/evolve`: Multi-objective code optimization using LLMs as mutation operators
- **Continuous Evolution**: Automated optimization cycles driven by performance metrics
- **Market Adaptation**: Code evolution guided by user feedback and market trends

### Autonomous Operation Modes
- **🛡️ Conservative**: Manual approval, stable approaches (3 evolution generations)
- **⚖️ Balanced**: Semi-autonomous with smart defaults (5 evolution generations)
- **🚀 Aggressive**: Full automation, maximum innovation (10 evolution generations)
