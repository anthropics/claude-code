Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster by executing routine tasks, explaining complex code, and handling git workflows -- all through natural language commands. Use it in your terminal, IDE, or tag @claude on Github.

**Learn more in the [official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)**.

## Troubleshooting

### "This organization has been disabled"

Claude Code can authenticate with either a Pro/Max subscription login or an
Anthropic API key. If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in your shell or system
environment, Claude Code uses that API key. This can surface an organization
error when the API key belongs to a disabled organization, even if your
subscription login is active.

Check whether an API key is set:

```bash
if [ -n "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" ]; then echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set"; fi
```

If you want Claude Code to use your subscription login instead, unset the API
key for the current terminal session:

```bash
unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
claude
```

On Windows PowerShell, run:

```powershell
if ($Env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) { "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set" }
Remove-Item Env:\ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
claude
```

If the variable keeps returning, remove the export from your shell profile,
terminal profile, system environment variables, or project-specific environment
files. If no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set and the error still appears, the account
or organization state may need support review.
