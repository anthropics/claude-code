## 🌟 Example Enhanced Workflow

Here's how to use your enhanced Claude Code:

### 1. Start Claude Code
```bash
claude
```

### 2. Run Complete Development Workflow
```bash
# Step 1: Establish principles
/constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing, and user experience

# Step 2: Define what to build
/specify Build a photo album organizer with drag-and-drop functionality for organizing photos by date

# Step 3: Clarify requirements (optional)
/clarify

# Step 4: Create technical plan
/plan Use React with TypeScript, minimal dependencies, local storage for metadata

# Step 5: Generate tasks
