# Zero-Trust Security Framework for Claude Code

A comprehensive security framework that implements client-side secret detection and replacement to prevent real secrets from being transmitted to Claude's API.

## Overview

The Zero-Trust Security Framework provides a complete zero-trust architecture that:

1. **Automatically detects** common types of secrets (API keys, access tokens, etc.)
2. **Replaces** real values with safe placeholders before transmission
3. **Allows** safe analysis while keeping real secrets local-only
4. **Verifies** security claims using formal methods (Coq proofs)
5. **Integrates** seamlessly with Claude Code's hook system

## Features

### Secret Detection
- Pattern-based detection for common secret types
- Entropy analysis for random-looking strings
- Context-aware detection to reduce false positives
- Custom detection modules for specialized needs

### Zero-Trust Processing
- Automatic replacement of secrets with placeholders
- Bidirectional mapping between secrets and placeholders
- Content restoration for local execution
- Performance-optimized processing pipeline

### Verification Engine
- Coq proof generation for security claims
- Formal verification of security properties
- Evidence-based assertion validation
- Integration with existing verification tools

### Claude Code Integration
- PreToolUse hook for tool call sanitization
- PostToolUse hook for result validation
- File operation hooks for content processing
- Response validation for AI-generated content

## Installation

The framework can be used directly as a Claude Code hook:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code.git
cd claude-code
```

## Usage

### As a Claude Code Hook

Add to your Claude Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "preToolUseHooks": [
    {
      "path": "./examples/hooks/zero_trust_security/framework/hooks"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Direct Usage

```python
from zero_trust_security.framework import ZeroTrustProcessor

# Create processor with default detectors
processor = ZeroTrustProcessor()

# Process content
content = "export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
processed_content, mapping = processor.process_content(content)

print(processed_content)
# Output: export <OPENAI_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER_001>
```

## Supported Secret Types

- OpenAI API Keys (`sk-` followed by 48 characters)
- Anthropic API Keys (`sk-ant-` followed by 94 characters and ending with `R`)
- AWS Access Keys (`AKIA` followed by 16 uppercase letters/numbers)
- GitHub Personal Access Tokens
- Google API Keys
- Slack Tokens
- JWT Tokens
- High-entropy strings (potential secrets)
